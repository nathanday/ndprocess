# NDProcess

##About
Added open request, used to be on my .mac account, could be updated a bit to take advantage of modern Cocoa/Objective-C features. Is a wrapper for Apples Carboin process library.

### Licensing
**NDJSON** using an MIT-style license which means use as you wish just give me credit where appropriate.

### Automatic Reference Counting.
**NDJSON** can be used in *Automatic Reference Counting* projects by setting the flag *-fno-objc-arc* for the .m files, this turns off *Automatic Reference Counting* for just these files. The NSProcess class itself could be updated to work with automatic reference counting.
